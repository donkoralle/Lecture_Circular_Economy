# Electronic Learning Session 1: Playing around with the Circularity Deck

Welcome! In this session you will:


## First of All

In case you have not done it yet, please form groups of two. You can find the groups list here:

[ICE Groups.xlsx](https://imcfhkrems.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/teams/LV_78861/Shared%20Documents/General/ICE_Groups.xlsx?d=wceb5e319044c4c189cf04e6d8339bf87&csf=1&web=1&e=nfrcZJ)

👉 Please **remember your group number** for further reference during this session.

## What is the circularity Deck?

During his PhD **Jan Konietzko** developed a card deck to support the design of circular products and services. The deck contains 36 cards, each representing a different circular strategy. You can find more information about the deck here:

🔗 [Circularity Deck](https://www.circularitydeck.com/)

But let's listen to Jan himself explaining the Circularity Deck:

🤔 So ... what's next?

## Let's pick a Design Challenge!

In this session you will work on a design challenge using the Circularity Deck. The main goal is to further improve the circularity of a given product or service. To do so, you have to pick one of the following design challenges:

We want to improve the circularity of ...

1. ... a **washing machine** (something like [this](https://www.miele.at/product/12703560))
2. ... a **folding bicycle** (something like [this](https://www.brompton.com/c-line))
3. ... the Mensa (canteen) at our IMC campus Krems (see [here](https://www.mensen.at/standort/mensa-campus-krems/))
4. ... of a roasting company & coffee shop (something like [this](https://kaffeecampuskrems.at/))

Have you picked your design challenge? Great! Let's move on ...

## Check our Design Challenge!

Before you start brainstorming ideas, take time to understand the current state of your chosen design challenge. Familiarise yourself with the selected product or service, and then consider whether any R-strategies have already been applied in its current design. Document your findings, as this will help you identify areas for improvement and guide your brainstorming session.

## Applying the Circularity Deck to your Design Challenge

Now it's time to get creative! You will use the Circularity Deck, brainstorm ideas on how to improve the circularity of your chosen design challenge. Since this is a self-guided learning session, we will use the online version of the Circularity Deck for this purpose. This online version is basically a pre-srtuctered Miro board. You can find the group-specific Miro boards here:

👉 Please note that you will need the **password provided in our Teams channel** to access these boards.

After opening your group-specific Miro board, I recommend watching the following video tutorial by Jan Konietzko. In this video, he explains how to use this board-based version of the Circularity Deck effectively. You can find the video tutorial on top of the board, but for your convenience, I've also embedded it below:
